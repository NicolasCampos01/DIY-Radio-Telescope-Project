# DIY-Radio-Telescope-Project

This repo holds codes for a DIY radio telescope project. We aim to study the galactic rotation curve by detecting the 21 cm hydrogen spectral line. Inspired by Jonathan Williams and the RET program at the University of West Virginia.

# Key Points
Codes for data processing, data obtained with the telescope and GNU Radio Software.

# How We Work:

Calibrating data, analyzing relationships, and fixing baselines.
Pinning down the galactic rotation curve.
Thoughts on the mass discrepancy we found.

# Quick Facts
Despite hiccups in getting our own data, we did a deep dive into results from Haw√°i University. This repo hosts the codes we used to crunch the numbers, giving a solid look at the galactic rotation curve.
 The mass discrepancy we spotted hints at dark matter. This DIY radio telescope isn't just about building something cool; it's a potential step into galactic exploration with smart tech.

# Bottom Line
This project isn't just about building a radio telescope at home; it's about adding our bit to understanding our galaxy. The mass discrepancy we see, echoing the work of Vera Rubin, adds a cool historical twist. Despite hurdles, this work signifies a significant jump in exploring the universe using accessible tech and scientific creativity.
